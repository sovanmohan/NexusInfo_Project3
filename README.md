# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis Prediction Model with NLTK
# Description:
This project builds a sentiment analysis model using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. The model analyzes text data and classifies it as expressing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

# Key Functionalities:
# Data Acquisition:

Obtain a sentiment analysis dataset containing text snippets and their corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) from reputable sources.
The data can come from online reviews, social media posts, or custom-collected datasets.
# Data Preprocessing:

Clean the text data by removing noise (e.g., punctuation, special characters, URLs, HTML tags).
Lowercase the text for consistency.
Consider tokenization (splitting text into individual words) for further analysis.
Address potential stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form) if necessary.
Feature Engineering:

Explore creating features that might be indicative of sentiment, such as:
Word frequency counts (e.g., positive words, negative words).
N-grams (sequences of words).
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging to identify sentiment-related words (e.g., adjectives, adverbs).
# Model Training:

Train a machine learning model for sentiment classification using NLTK and scikit-learn libraries.
Common choices include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Logistic Regression.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
# Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analyze the confusion matrix to understand how well the model differentiates between different sentiment classes.
# Prediction:

Allow users to input new text data for sentiment prediction using the trained model.
# Dependencies:
# Python libraries:
NLTK
pandas (for data manipulation)
scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualization - optional)
Running the Script:
Install required libraries using pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn (optional for visualization).
Modify the script (e.g., sentiment_analysis.py) to specify the data source path and format (e.g., CSV).
Execute the script to perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and potentially enable user input for sentiment prediction on new text data.
